    <ul>
      <li>ground beef or pork-beef meat (500g)</li>
      <li>tomato paste - 3 tablespoons (50g)</li>
      <li>canned tomatoes - 1 piece (400g)</li>
      <li>red onion - 2 pcs. (200g)</li>
      <li>garlic - 3 cloves</li>
      <li>oil for frying - 2 tbsp</li>
      <li>sweet pepper - 2 tsp</li>
      <li>ground chili, flaked or fresh - 1 flat tsp</li>
      <li>Worcester / Worcestershire sauce - 1 tbsp</li>
      <li>oregano - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>ground cumin - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>sugar - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>salt pepper</li>
      <li>hot dog buns - 5 pcs. (200g)</li>
      <li>ham sausage (at least 90-95% meat content) - 5 items (200g)</li>
      <li>mustard</li>
      <li>onion - 1 small piece (80g)</li>
      <li>cheese, sprinkled for spreading - 70g</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the onion into small cubes. Warm up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion. Fry it over medium heat, and after a minute add a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar.
       Caramelize the onion for 2 minutes, then add the crushed garlic and fry for 30 seconds.</li>
       <li>Put 2 teaspoons of pepper, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin and about 1 teaspoon of ground chili in a pan with onions and garlic – there can also be flakes or fresh chili,
       add enough to make it spicy, as you like. Fry the spices for a minute.</li>
       <li>Add meat to the pan, season with freshly ground pepper, salt and oregano, and add worcester sauce. 
        Shred meat with a wooden spatula and fry the whole on medium heat, stirring from time to time until the meat is slightly browned (about 10 minutes).</li>
       <li>In the middle of the pan, make an empty circle between meat – in this place add tomato paste and fry it for a while on high heat. Then pour the canned tomatoes. 
        Mix and stew until the tomatoes disintegrate and most of the liquid evaporates – the chili sauce must be very thick so that it does not slide off the hot dogs. </li>
     </ol>
